### Learning Objective
Reinforce networking concepts learned previously by understanding
how real-world web communication operates over networks.

---

### Platforms Used
- TryHackMe (Pre-Security Path)

---

### Cybersecurity Topics Covered

#### Web Communication Over Networks (TryHackMe)
Module completed:
- How the Web Works

Key understanding:
- How clients and servers communicate using HTTP/HTTPS
- How requests and responses travel across the network
- How DNS, ports, and protocols fit into the communication flow
- How web traffic builds on top of basic networking concepts

---

### Notes
- Used this module to connect packets, frames, and network flow to real web usage
- Helped reinforce concepts learned from Professor Messer networking sections
- Spent time revising instead of introducing new hardware topics for clarity

---

### Next Steps
- Resume CompTIA A+ hardware topics after networking consolidation
- Start with basics of OS (Linux and Windows)

---

### Reflection and Resolution
- It's starting to get a bit confusing with too many terms
- Slow down and make sure to understand rather than cruising through it
