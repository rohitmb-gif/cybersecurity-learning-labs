---

### Platforms Used
- TryHackMe (Pre-Security Path)
- Professor Messer – CompTIA A+ (220-1101)

---

### Cybersecurity Topics Covered

#### Security Domains Overview (TryHackMe)
Rooms completed:
- Offensive Security Introduction
- Defensive Security Introduction

Security understanding:
- Difference between offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) roles
- How both domains rely on the same foundational knowledge
- Importance of understanding systems before attempting exploitation or defense

---

#### Networking Foundations (TryHackMe)
Rooms completed:
- What is Networking

Security understanding:
- Basic idea of how devices communicate over networks
- Networking as the backbone of all cybersecurity operations
- Why understanding data flow is critical before using security tools

---

#### Infrastructure Awareness for Security (CompTIA A+)
Sections covered:
