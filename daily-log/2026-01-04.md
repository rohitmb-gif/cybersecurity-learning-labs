### Learning Objective
Build strong networking fundamentals required for understanding System vulnerabilities.

---

### Platforms Used
- TryHackMe (Pre-Security Path)
- Professor Messer – CompTIA A+ (220-1101)

---

### Cybersecurity Topics Covered

#### Networking Foundations (TryHackMe)
Rooms completed:
- Intro to LAN
- OSI Model

Security understanding:
- How devices communicate within a local network
- Role of switches and routers in internal networks
- OSI model as a framework to locate attacks, defenses, and failures

---

#### Infrastructure Awareness for Security (CompTIA A+)
Sections covered:
- 2.1 Ports And Protocols
- 2.2 Wireless Networks
- 2.3 Network Services
- 2.4 Network Configurations

Security relevance:
- Network types define scope and attack surfaces
- Network devices act as control and monitoring points
- Network services are common attack targets

---

### Notes
- Focused on networking strictly from a cybersecurity perspective
- Learned basics of OSI Models and Data handling across networks
- Focus on A+ only to understand infrastructure attackers interact with

---

### Next Steps
- Study Network Devices, tools and Connections
- Learn Hardwares and rest of IT fundamentals.
