### Learning Objective
Introduce basic Linux concepts relevant to cybersecurity while
strengthening hardware fundamentals and revising core networking concepts.

---

### Platforms Used
- TryHackMe
- Professor Messer – CompTIA A+ (220-1101)
- roadmap.sh

---

### Cybersecurity Topics Covered

#### Linux Basics (TryHackMe)
Module completed:
- Linux Fundamentals

Key understanding:
- Basic Linux command-line usage
- File system structure and navigation
- Importance of Linux as a foundational environment in cybersecurity

---

#### Hardware Foundations (CompTIA A+)
Sections covered:
- 3.1 Cables
- 3.2 Connectors
- 3.3 RAM

Learning focus:
- Identifying common hardware components
- Understanding where hardware knowledge supports system awareness

---

#### Learning Consolidation
Resource used:
- roadmap.sh

Revision focus:
- Reviewed networking fundamentals learned so far
- Revisited key concepts to ensure clarity before progressing further

---

### Notes
- Used Linux Fundamentals as a gentle introduction rather than deep practice
- Continued hardware learning to build baseline system understanding
- Spent time revising previous topics to avoid shallow learning

---

### Next Steps
- Continue Linux Fundamentals with hands-on practice
- Resume CompTIA A+ hardware topics gradually
- Begin applying Linux concepts in basic security-related tasks

---

### Refelection and Resolution
- It is feeling too much to learn as the new terminologies keep popping up
- Make Sure to keep a seperate Note of these terms and Their uses
