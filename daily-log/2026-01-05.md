### Learning Objective
Understand how data moves across networks and how network expansion
affects security visibility and attack surfaces.

---

### Platforms Used
- TryHackMe (Pre-Security Path)
- Professor Messer – CompTIA A+ (220-1101)

---

### Cybersecurity Topics Covered

#### Data Transmission and Network Expansion (TryHackMe)
Rooms completed:
- Packets and Frames
- Extending Your Network

Security understanding:
- Difference between frames and packets and their roles at different layers
- How data is encapsulated and transmitted across networks
- How extending a network increases complexity and potential attack paths
- Importance of segmentation and controlled expansion for security

---

#### Infrastructure Components for Security (CompTIA A+)
Sections covered:
- 2.5 Network Devices
- 2.6 Network configurations
- 2.7 Network Connections
- 2.8 Network Tools
  
Security relevance:
- Network devices act as control, routing, and monitoring points
- Network configurations affect visibility, access, and segmentation
- Network connections define exposure to internal and external threats
- Network tools support monitoring, analysis, and incident response

---

### Notes
- Understood the basic difference between frames and packets and how data is wrapped and passed through the network
- Learned how switches and routers handle data at different points in a network
- Saw how adding devices, wireless access, and connections changes how a network is laid out
- Learned the purpose of common network devices, configurations, connections, and tools at a foundational level


---

### Next Steps
- Study how the web works (THM through rooms)
- Hardware { Professor Messer – CompTIA A+ (220-1101)}
